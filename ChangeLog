    * fixed bug #0001
}

    + Basic frame is completed
    * Published onto GitHub
    * Fixed dead lock partially

    {
        I need to say something about the condition_variable...

        The dead lock was cause like this (ordered in time):
        (Thread role)   (pseudocode)                (return)
            Sub         check_if_need_terminate()   false
            Main        terminate_all()             none
            Main        notify_all_threads          none
            Sub         wait_until_notified()       none

        Does anybody has any idea?

        I just changed the wait function from wait() to wait_for(1ms)...
    }
